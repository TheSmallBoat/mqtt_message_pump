Based on this sample information, the program will automatically parse and generate the relevant database table structure, and perform data insertion actions.
The first level supports multiple data records, and the other subsets support multiple levels of nested information structures.
The database field corresponds to the sample Key value and supports free addition.
At the same time, the program can roughly determine the type of the data field.
